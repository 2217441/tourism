        can be overwhelming if you don't know where to start. Here are some tips
        to help you plan your trip to Malaysia.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Decide when to go. Malaysia has a tropical climate with hot and humid
          weather all year round. However, there are some variations depending
          on the region and season. The west coast of Peninsular Malaysia is
          generally dry from November to February and wet from May to October.
          The east coast of Peninsular Malaysia and the islands of Sabah and
          Sarawak are generally dry from March to October and wet from November
          to February. The best time to visit Malaysia depends on your
          preferences and activities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Decide where to go. Malaysia has a lot of attractions and destinations
          to choose from. You can visit the bustling capital city of Kuala
          Lumpur, the historic city of Malacca, the cultural island of Penang,
          the scenic highlands of Cameron or Genting, the tropical islands of
          Langkawi or Tioman, the wildlife-rich states of Sabah or Sarawak, and
          more. You can also combine different regions and islands to get a
          taste of everything. However, you should also consider your budget,
          time, and interests when deciding where to go.
        </li>
        <li>
          Book your flights and accommodation. Once you have decided when and
          where to go, you can start booking your flights and accommodation. You
          can use online platforms such as Skyscanner or Expedia to compare
          prices and options for flights and hotels. You can also use Airbnb or
          Booking.com to find alternative accommodation such as apartments or
          homestays. You should book your flights and accommodation as early as
          possible to get the best deals and availability.
        </li>
        <li>
          Plan your itinerary and activities. After booking your flights and
          accommodation, you can start planning your itinerary and activities.
          You can use online resources such as TripAdvisor or Lonely Planet to
          find out what to see and do in each destination. You can also use
          Google Maps or Maps.me to plan your routes and transportation. You
          should also check the weather forecast and local events before you go.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pack your essentials and enjoy your trip. Finally, you can pack your
          essentials and get ready for your trip. You should pack light and
          bring only what you need. Some of the essentials you should bring are
          your passport, visa, flight tickets, accommodation confirmation,
          travel insurance, money, credit cards, phone, charger, adapter,
          camera, sunscreen, insect repellent, hat, sunglasses, umbrella,
          raincoat, clothes, shoes, toiletries, medications, and a copy of your
          itinerary. You should also check the customs and immigration
          regulations of Malaysia before you go. Once you have everything ready,
          you can enjoy your trip to Malaysia and have a wonderful time.
